Abstract: The Bank Management System is a C++ program, designed as a console-based application, that offers a comprehensive set of features for users to engage in basic banking operations. This system incorporates file handling, utilizing a file named "account.dat" to persistently store account information. Additionally, it employs object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, making use of a vector to efficiently manage and store bank account details.

Users have the flexibility to perform various banking tasks through an intuitive menu-driven interface. The operations include creating new bank accounts, viewing account details, searching for specific accounts, depositing funds, withdrawing funds, and checking account balances. The program ensures accuracy and efficiency in its execution, providing users with a seamless and user-friendly experience.


Explanation:

Class Structure

The program defines a class named "account" to encapsulate the properties and methods related to a bank account.
The class includes methods for creating an account, displaying account details, modifying account information, depositing and withdrawing funds, and reporting account information.

Menu-Driven Interface

The main function implements a menu-driven interface using a switch-case structure, allowing users to choose from different banking operations.

File Handling

The program utilizes file handling to read and write account details to the "account.dat" file.
Functions like write_account(), display_sp(), modify_account(), delete_account(), and display_all() interact with the file for various operations.

Account Operations

Users can create a new account, deposit or withdraw funds, check balances, and perform other account-related operations.
The program ensures data integrity by using file operations to persist account information.


Note:

1) The code is structured with clear function names and comments for better readability.
2) Proper error handling is included to address scenarios like file not opening, records not found, or insufficient balance.
3) The system provides a clean and intuitive interface for users to interact with the banking functionalities.


Conclusion:
The Bank Management System is a robust C++ program that demonstrates fundamental concepts of file handling and class-based design. It allows users to perform typical banking operations and serves as a foundation for more advanced features and enhancements.
